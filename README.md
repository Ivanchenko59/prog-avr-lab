# prog-avr-lab
## Description
This repository contains laboratory work on the subject 
"Programming microcontrollers and microcomputers"

Some tasks can be slightly changed by me (towards complication). Due to the fact that the examples are executed in the simulator, I may not have some components from the simulator.

## Table of content
>>According to the assignment, each laboratory work contains several examples, and tasks for 
>>them. Each lab will contain folders with tasks, which will contain one file. 
>>All sub-tasks will be executed in this file.

Attention, below are the names of EXAMPLES from the lab. These are not the names of the tasks themselves. This is for ease of search.
